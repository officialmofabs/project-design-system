This folder includes a configuration for building dev containers or reviewing PRs inside of another dev container - "Inception" style ðŸ˜Ž. It includes the Moby/Docker and a desktop with VS Code stable, insiders, and the Remote - Containers extension installed for quick testing of local scenarios when needed.

A web-based desktop viewer is automatically forwarded. The login password is `vscode`.

Run F1 / Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + p and select **Ports: Focus on Ports View** to see the address to use to connect to it.

If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can click the badge above or [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers) to get started. Clicking these links will cause VS Code to automatically install the Remote - Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.

However, most likely, this was not what you were looking for when you came to this repository. Actual dev container definitions can be found [under the `/containers` folder](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/containers) in this repository.
